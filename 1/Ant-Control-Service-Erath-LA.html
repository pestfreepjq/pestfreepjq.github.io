<p>Biological pest control measures make the most of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs initial task is to establish acceptable pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls where the thresholds are crossed. Understanding of these thresholds and characteristics of pests and natural opponents helps to avoid unneeded (chemical) interventions.

Some need long-lasting agreements that cost $400 or more although for most pests, a single treatment done well must be adequate.
