<p>For some jobs, pest control workers use a mix of pest management methods, a practice referred to as integrated pest management. The foundation of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of regular assessments. Crop losses due to arthropods, weeds, and illness, though challenged by some as a legitimate measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the intensification of pest control.</p>
<p>The term "incorporated" was therefore synonymous with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be used just after routine monitoring suggested that a pest population had actually reached a level (the economic limit) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would go beyond the expense of the control procedures.</p>
