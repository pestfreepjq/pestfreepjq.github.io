<p>We historically have actually offered nature short, both in its ability to neutralize the efficiency of environmentally unsound methods along with its variety of inherent strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, strains of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, therefore increasing the likelihood that some will survive insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
