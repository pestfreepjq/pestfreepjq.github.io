<p>IPM approaches include both chemical and nonchemical means to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the smallest efficient dose when other methods of pest control have actually failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques such as biological control, habitat manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>The various contributors involved in the value chain of the insect pest control market consist of raw material providers, R&D institutes, insect pest control solutions manufacturing companies such as Bayer (Germany), Syngenta (Switzerland), BASF (Germany), FMC Corporation (US), and federal government bodies & regulatory associations such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Pest Management Regulatory Firm (PMRA).</p>
<p>In reference to the concept of integrating the use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later on expanded to welcome coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have higher levels of resistance. </p>
<p>Using details about pests' biology and practices, along with a toolbox of pest management methods, pest control workers find, identify, and remove pests. However because these "sex" traps attract mostly male insects, they aren't really effective controls. This includes mechanical, physical, cultural, chemical and biological control of pest. A routine monitoring program is the basis of IPM decision making, no matter the control strategies used.</p>
