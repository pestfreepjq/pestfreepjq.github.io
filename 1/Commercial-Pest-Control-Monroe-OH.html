Truly satisfactory options to pest problems will require a shift to understanding and promoting naturally occurring biological agents and other intrinsic strengths as elements of overall farming environments and creating our cropping systems so that these natural forces keep the pests within appropriate bounds.</p>
<p>Making use of restorative tools, whether biological, chemical, or physical, as the main ways of managing pests rather than as occasional supplements to natural regulators to bring them into acceptable bounds violates fundamental unifying concepts and can not be sustainable.

These pests are simply anywhere and all over, be it houses, workplaces, companies, dining places, hotels etc, anywhere which is not actually maintained effectively and is not sanitary.</p>
<p>Management of trap and nursery crops and surrounding environment is likewise included to divert insect attack away from the crop. Managing pests can be performed in numerous ways but an effective way is to clean out the bugs routinely.
