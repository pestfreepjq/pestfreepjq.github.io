Effective, less dangerous pest controls are selected first, consisting of highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to interrupt pest breeding, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Assessment is often one of the most crucial actions in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the procedure of evaluating an IPM program and the results it has produced.</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which allowed regional farmers to harness their indigenous understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the selection and usage of pest control actions that will ensure beneficial financial condition, environmental and social consequences 13 and applies to most farming, public health and facility pest management circumstances.</p>
