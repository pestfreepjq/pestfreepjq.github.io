<p>All countries acknowledged IPM as a preferable technique to pest control even if it was not commonly embraced. Pests are a major danger that damage crops and turn farmers' efforts into a wild-goose chase and resources.

After carrying out any pest management strategy, inspect the sign plants to assess if arthropod pests have been eliminated and examine the effectiveness and longevity of control.</p>
