<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the best for other organisms and for air, soil, and water quality; use pesticides in bait stations instead of sprays; or spot-spray a few weeds rather of a whole area. Due to any number of factors, consisting of those pointed out in the Chemical and Cultural sections, jeopardizing the effectiveness of natural opponents often permits potential pest organisms to experience practically uncontrolled population growth and allows them to reach pest status.</p>
