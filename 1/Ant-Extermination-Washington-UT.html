<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, proper watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the ecosystem as a whole and considers a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control approaches to produce the most effective and least destructive plan.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, it is likewise based on semiochemicals particularly kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are fended off or hindered far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are at the same time brought in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or removed 35 (Figure 5 ). Many pesticide issues are brought on by a little number of the pesticides readily available today. </p>
<p>Kaolin particle films utilized in organic farming might control some pests, but can negatively affect natural enemies and cause other pests to multiply (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices may encourage natural opponent populations, but a greater variety of natural opponents does not always result in pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling utilize fossil fuels and indirectly have an unfavorable effect on the environment.</p>
