<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM method by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not remove since growers were not all set for such an intercropping plan. If your facility presently uses an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be shocked to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact services and products.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was thus synonymous with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be used just after regular tracking showed that a pest population had reached a level (the financial threshold) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would exceed the expense of the control measures.</p>
<p>In reference to the idea of incorporating making use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on expanded to accept coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been selected either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have greater levels of resistance. </p>
<p>Perennial crops represent special challenges and opportunities for IPM and they represent a great design for examining its concepts and execution.
