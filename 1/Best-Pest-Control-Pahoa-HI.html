Reliable pest management depends upon the accurate identification of the pest. Keep a planting-free zone of about 12 inches around structures to dissuade insects from getting in.

<p>In Asia, numerous stages of IPM have actually been effectively adopted in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, vegetables), India (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, vegetables), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (veggies, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997). </p>

By creating an environment that's unwelcoming to pests, you can take away their advantage and give it to your plants. Employers typically provide pest controller training programs covering pesticide application and crucial aspects of the job like managing rodents and termites.</p>
