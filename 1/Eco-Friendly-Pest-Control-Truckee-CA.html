Lots of countries have actually phased out broad-spectrum pesticides and fumigants. Applicators use a broader variety of pesticides and handle more serious pests such as termites, in addition to fumigating houses to deal with large-scale invasions.</p>
<p>If a pest or disease causes unacceptable damage regardless of preventative efforts, pick an efficient management approach that will have the least quantity of effect on other living animals and the environment. Examples include growing of alternate hosts (e.g., weeds), crop rotation, choice of planting websites, trap crops, and changing the timing of planting or harvest.</p>
