<p>Termites are such destructive pests that you want your termite treatment to result in termite extermination. When identification, action, and tracking thresholds indicate that pest control is required, and preventive approaches are no longer effective or offered, IPM programs then assess the proper control method both for efficiency and threat. The letter of invitation for this plenary address suggested for its title the main theme of the whole Congress, i.e., the affirmative sentence: "Integrated Pest Management: A Global Truth".</p>
<p>Chemical insecticides were to be utilized in the way least disruptive to biological control.
