<p>4 ). With its success in lots of parts of the world, IPM is deemed a economical and environmentally benign pest control method ideally matched for both little and large farmers around the globe. Once termites have gone into a building, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more.

<p>Biological control has actually been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control technique is usually used where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has been successfully used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural opponents and discourage pest determination include intercropping (multiple crops in the same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with choose application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
