Biological pathogens: Bacillus thuringiensis, also called Bt, is a soil-borne bacterium that battles mosquitoes and insects in the larval, caterpillar stage.</p>
<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control technique is usually used where natural opponents from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has been effectively used versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
