<p>In referral to the idea of integrating making use of biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later broadened to embrace collaborated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been selected either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have greater levels of resistance.</p>
<p>Utilizing natural opponents as a curative control is less successful compared to applying them preventively. Use suitable hunting methods and treatment choices to protect the advantageous insects that can offer additional bug pest control.
