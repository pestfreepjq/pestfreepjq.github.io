Crops are often monocultures, consisting of a single crop species, which develops a homogenous habitat often lacking crucial requirements of natural enemies, therefore preferring pest species.</p>
<p>Proper hunting also provides information that help to quantify the advancement of pests and natural enemies. In time, with the glue-board tracking program and insect submissions, the committee will end up being familiar with the kinds of pests come across in the building and the characteristics of the populations.
