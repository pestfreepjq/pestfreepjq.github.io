The chemical controls are applied only after routine tracking suggests that a pest population had actually reached an economic limit level. Numerous specific commodity growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to define what IPM indicates for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in restricted areas.</p>

<p>The behavior of the pest can be made use of for its tracking and control through baits, traps, and breeding disruption strategies (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, VladÃ©s et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ).

<p>This approach of pest control has fallen out of favour in current years considering that fire eliminates advantageous insects along with the pests and can have a negative influence on the soil. To lessen possible harm to advantageous insects, limit your spraying to small areas where you can see pests prowling, and leave a number of unsprayed "havens" for any good bugs you can't see.</p>
