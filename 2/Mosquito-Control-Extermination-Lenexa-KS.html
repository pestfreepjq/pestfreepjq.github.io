<p>This might include the use of multiple pesticides with different modes of action. Trap crops are planted to draw in and hold pest insects where they can be handled more efficiently and prevent or minimize their motion onto valuable crops.

Biological pathogens: Bacillus thuringiensis, also known as Bt, is a soil-borne bacterium that fights mosquitoes and insects in the larval, caterpillar stage.</p>

Pest control has to do with non-lethal techniques too, such as keeping the location free and tidy of any food particles or other attractants, sealing up entry ways such as cracks in walls or the area between the bottom of a door and the flooring. </p>
<p>This technique of pest control has fallen out of favour in recent decades because fire eliminates useful insects in addition to the pests and can have an unfavorable effect on the soil. To decrease possible damage to useful insects, limit your spraying to small locations where you can see pests prowling, and leave a number of unsprayed "havens" for any excellent bugs you can't see.</p>
