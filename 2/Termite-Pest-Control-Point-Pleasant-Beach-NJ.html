<p>When pest problems are prevented, pests are not present to do damage, so no control steps are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis solutions or its cry toxins in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well documented.</p>
<p>The new ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) technology where double-stranded RNA is used to silence specific genes in the target insect is thought about as biopesticide application (Gordon and Waterhouse 2007 ). Certain biostimulants based upon minerals, microorganisms, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart caused systemic resistance to pests, diseases, and abiotic stress factors, but are used as changes with no claims for pest or illness control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ).
