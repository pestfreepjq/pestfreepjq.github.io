<p>1. Chemical Pest Control. Pests can be substantial obstacle to the development of your business. However, some professionals interpret IPM as turning chemicals from various mode of action groups to preserve pest control effectiveness and minimize pesticide resistance with an emphasis on minimizing pest damage. Entomopathogenic nematodes can be utilized versus certain soil pests, bacteria, and infections versus pests with chewing mouthparts such as Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, while fungi are effective against a variety of pests.</p>
