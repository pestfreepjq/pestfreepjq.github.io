Due to their wood-eating practices, termites can do fantastic damage to houses and other wooden structures.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to keep an eye on for pests and identify them accurately, so that appropriate control choices can be made in conjunction with action thresholds. However, the significant trend has actually been toward the use of modern-day chemistry and molecular biology to replace standard pesticides with less hazardous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based items; but these methods are still therapies.</p>

Before presenting a crop into a greenhouse it is necessary to eliminate weeds, algae, pet plants," and any plant and growing medium debris situated throughout the greenhouse, especially beneath benches, due to the fact that these supply refuge for arthropod pests.</p>
