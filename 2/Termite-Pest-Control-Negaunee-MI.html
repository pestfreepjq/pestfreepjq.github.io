<p>The term "incorporated" was thus associated with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be used just after routine monitoring suggested that a pest population had reached a level (the economic limit) that required treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would surpass the cost of the control steps.</p>

Artificial chemical pesticides are the most commonly used method of pest control.</p>
