IPM coordinates using pest biology, ecological information, and readily available innovation to avoid unacceptable levels of pest damage by the most economical methods, while reducing threat to individuals, property, resources, and the environment.</p>
<p>With IPM you'll utilize the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the best for other organisms and for soil, water, and air quality; use pesticides in bait stations instead of sprays; or spot-spray a couple of weeds rather of an entire area. Due to any number of factors, consisting of those discussed in the Chemical and Cultural areas, compromising the effectiveness of natural opponents frequently enables potential pest organisms to experience virtually unregulated population growth and allows them to reach pest status.</p>
<p>If you ever see pests returning after treatment, Stay alert and contact your pest control expert for a follow-up treatment.
