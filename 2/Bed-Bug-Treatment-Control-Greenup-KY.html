Integrated Pest Management or IPM, as it is frequently known, is a system of handling pests which is designed to be sustainable.</p>
<h3>Pest Control Control Greenup Kentucky</h2>
<p>The idea of incorporated pest management (IPM), a sustainable method for handling pests, has actually remained in practice for a very long time. Crops genetically crafted to produce Bt contaminants are planted in millions of hectares worldwide. Freezer is also thought about a physical control and, although it does not always kill the insect pests, it at least stops their development and additional feeding on the stored crop.</p>
<p>Chemical pesticides are classified into various groups based upon their mode of action (IRAC 2018) and rotating chemicals from different mode of action groups is recommended to decrease the threat of resistance development (Sparks and Nauen 2015 ). Government policies restrict the time and amount of specific chemical pesticides and help alleviate the associated dangers.</p>
<p>A biological control program can be successful if these recommendations are followed: 1) properly determine all arthropod pests, 2) purchase natural enemies from a trusted biological control supplier, 3) ensure there is a consistent supply of high quality natural opponents, 4) highlight that appropriate shipping procedures be followed, and 5) obtain instructions from biological control suppliers on proper release rates and timing of application.</p>
