<p>The very best way to control pests is to make your home unattractive to them. However household pests can likewise be a danger to your household.

In many cases release of natural opponents even before the pest is present is possible, or required for optimal efficacy. The preliminary treatment consists of assessments, extermination of existing pests and border outside treatments.</p>
