With more policies on pesticide use and a decrease in the number of active components in some crops, there is a higher emphasis on better understanding of readily available control choices (Hillocks 2012 ). Regulative standards that limit using specific pesticides or promote using others can have a significant impact on IPM implementation.</p>
