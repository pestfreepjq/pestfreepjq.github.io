<p>Consider alternative methods (other than pesticides) to make your home and garden unattractive to pests. With IPM, you take actions to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can withstand pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a structure. Recent quests for reliable, safe, and lasting pest management programs have actually been targeted mainly toward advancement of brand-new and better products with which to change standard poisonous pesticides.</p>
<p>Regional pest control services utilize low-cost chemicals that only push back termites, causing them to spread out further and trigger extensive damage to your property. By correcting the conditions that result in pest problems and utilizing authorized pesticides only when essential, IPM provides more reliable pest control while minimizing pesticide use.
